          Wakefit has now been in existence since 2016. Over the last few years,
          we have serviced over 8 lakh customers, sold over 18 lakh products,
          and spent at least 1500 hours in research and development. We pride
          ourselves on being customer-centric and providing our customers with
          the very best home and sleep solutions. We have spent our initial
          years talking to our customers to understand their needs better and
          creating products that cater to those needs. After building a
          successful line of sleep products for our mattress store, we now have
          a line of home products online, designed to be ergonomic solutions for
          the modern Indian household. Our shift from being just a mattress
          company alone to one of the leading mattress and home furniture stores
          in India was inspired by the increasing demand for quality furniture
          in the country. From wooden shelves to bookcases to work from home
          furniture to living room furniture, we now have it all! Our aim is to
          be identified as a mattress store and also a furniture store online
          that offers everything you need for every part of your home. Today,
          Wakefit furniture is a part of every household.

        <p className="leading-6 font-semibold text-sm">
          When looking to buy ideal furniture online, we usually pick the most
          aesthetic-looking one. However, overlooking the ergonomic factor when
          you shop for furniture online can affect your posture, spine, and your
          overall well-being and productivity. For instance, a coffee table with
          sharp edges and the wrong height can be dangerous, especially in a
          home with young children or older people. Wooden furniture like an
          almirah or bookcase that isn’t stable enough can be another hazard.
          Furniture design by Wakefit considers everything, thus combining
          style, quality and practicality that most online furniture stores
          don’t. Being a modern brand of furniture in India, Wakefit creates
          ergonomic designs that offer optimal muscular and postural support,
          thus reducing aches and pains while maximizing your comfort and
          relaxation.
